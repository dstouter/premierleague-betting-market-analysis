# EPL Betting Market Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes English Premier League betting odds from 2003–2023
to evaluate how accurately betting markets predict match outcomes.

## Key Questions
- How often do home wins, away wins, and draws occur?
- Do implied probabilities from betting odds align with real outcomes?
- How does market confidence relate to match volatility and goal totals?

## Methodology
- Cleaned and filtered EPL match and odds data
- Converted bookmaker odds into implied probabilities
- Evaluated prediction accuracy and calibration
- Visualized expected vs actual outcomes over time

## Key Findings
- Betting markets are generally well-calibrated for home wins
- High-confidence matches show slight overestimation of home-win likelihood
- Expected and actual home-win rates diverge in certain seasons

## Tools
- R (dplyr, ggplot2, scales)
- Adobe Illustrator
